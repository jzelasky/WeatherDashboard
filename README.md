### Weather Dashboard

This web application is designed to allow the user to search for cities around the world and view the current weather for that city and a 5-day forecast of future conditions. 

### Usage

To use this web application type a city name into the search bar. It is not case sensitive but the city name does need to be spelled correctly. Submit the city name by either clicking 'enter' on the keyboard or by clicking the 'submit' button on the screen. The city name will be saved to the search history and the weather conditions for that city will populate. To view a previously searched city, click on that city name in the search history. Search history persists when page is refreshed. To clear search history click 'Clear Search History' button (only visible when search history exists).
